== Description ==

Favicon Rotator makes it easy to customize the favicon for your site.  Just add a favicon via the administration page and it will be displayed whenever someone visits your site.

#### Highlights
* **New: Set icon for Touch devices (Android, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, etc.)**
* Simply point and click to add a favicon to your site
* Supports adding **multiple icons**, from which a **randomly selected** favicon will be displayed.
* Automatic icon conversion for large images (smaller files and faster loading)

#### Usage
1. Go to **Theme > Favicon** admin page to add/upload image(s) to use for the favicon

**That's it! The favicon will be displayed in visitors' browsers when they visit your site**

**Notes**

* Verify that your theme uses the `wp_head()` template tag
* If you add multiple icons, then a randomly selected icon will be displayed each time the site is loaded
